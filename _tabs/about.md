Ordo Dei Invictus is a knightly order that embraces a path of direct allegiance to God, diverging from traditional knightly orders by boldly rejecting papal authority. Its mission centers on unmediated spiritual warfare, where members are guided solely by divine sovereignty over the order, rather than by ecclesiastical structures. Ordo Dei Invictus serves as a beacon, cultivating a deeper commitment to God’s will through unwavering resolve and direct action.

We stand as a **non-sectarian, inter-denominational and ecumenical** assembly, a noble coalition of diverse, theologically conservative Christians united in our quest to uphold divine truth. Free from the constraints of rigid man-made systems, we embrace a logical and reasoned approach to faith based on scripture, forging a path that transcends traditional boundaries and elevates our collective purpose.

In our defense of divine truth, we honor the spirit of courage and resilience, committed to advancing our mission **through peaceful means**. We welcome those who are prepared to stand firm in their convictions and take action in the name of the faith.

<!-- ## Mission Statement -->

<!-- ## Journey to Discernment

At this juncture, you may be curious about my involvement in a non-sectarian, inter-denominational and ecumenical knightly order while pursuing studies in physics. The answer lies in the necessity of defending the true Church. God calls us to seek education and understanding, as exemplified by Daniel, who received his training in Babylon (Dan. 1:3-5), and Moses, who was educated in Egypt (Acts 7:22; Exod. 2:10). This principle is further emphasized in Proverbs 4:7, which states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding." The pursuit of knowledge is crucial, as Hosea 4:6 warns, "My people are destroyed from lack of knowledge," highlighting the dire consequences of ignorance in our faith. Furthermore, 2 Timothy 2:15 encourages us to "do your best to present yourself to God as one approved," underscoring the importance of diligent study and correct handling of the word of truth. Colossians 2:6-8 reminds us to remain rooted in Christ and vigilant against hollow philosophies that deviate from the truth. Finally, 1 Peter 3:15 urges us to be prepared to give an answer for our hope, equipping us to defend our faith with gentleness and respect. Together, these verses affirm that education is not merely beneficial but essential for cultivating a robust and resilient Christian faith.

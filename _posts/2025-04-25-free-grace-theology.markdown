This is a review of a book written by a concerned Cambridge-educated research professor, Dr. Wayne Grudem, and endorsed by members of Dallas Theological Seminary. This book exposes a new sect, also known as Chaferanism, which emerged in the 80s claiming to provide new insights into salvation that contradicted Scripture, altered key lexicon meanings, went against hundreds of years of Protestant teachings, and thousands of years of Christianity.

<!-- This movement teaches the abuse of the precious grace of our god, twisting it into a license to sin (Jd 4 NET), and has even silenced the words of Christ on repentance and the evidences of fruit bearing. -->

<!-- In the 1980s, a sect emerged claiming to provide new insights into salvation that contradicted Scripture, hundreds of years of Protestant teachings, and thousands of years of Christianity. Many faithful scholars have stood up against these false teachings and have since exposed the sect's misinterpretation of Scripture and key lexicons.  -->

> “This book is charitable yet rock-solid in its penetrating insights reguarding the Free Grace movement. The soteriology of this movement is thoroughly consistent&mdash;and **deeply flawed**.” &mdash; Daniel B. Wallace, Senior Professor of New Testament Studies (PhD, **Dallas Theological Seminary**)

> “Credence without commitment and assurance without action are the hallmarks of the so-called Free Grace version of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is, however, **unbiblical, anti-evangelical, and sub-Christian**, as Grudem's patient and well informed analysis clearly shows.” &mdash; J. I. Packer, Board of Governors' Professor of Theology, Regent College & Time magazine top 25 evangelical (PhD, University of Oxford)

> “With care and weighty biblical and historical argumentation, Grudem applies his clear-headed reasoning to show where the Free Grace view has gone wrong. Because this disagreement has to do with the very nature of the Gospel, saving faith, and the basis of assurance, it is critical that Christians understand rightly what Scripture teaches on these matters” &mdash; Bruce A. Ware, T. Rupert and Lucille Coleman Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary (PhD, Fuller Theological Seminary)

## Not the &ldquo;Faith Alone&rdquo; of the Reformation

### A. Protestant leaders throughout history have consistently disagreed with the Free Grace position. This section will show 500 years worth of confessions.

## No Call To Repent Of Sins

> “Therefore **repent and turn back so that your sins may be wiped out**,” (The NET Bible: Full Notes Edition, 2019, Acts 3:19).

> “and repentance **for the forgiveness of sins** would be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.” (The NET Bible: Full Notes Edition, 2019, Luke 24:47).

> “God raised up his servant and sent him first to you, to bless you by turning each one of you from your iniquities” (The NET Bible: Full Notes Edition, 2019, Acts 3:26).

## False Assurance

## Underemphasizing Trust in the Person of Christ

## Unlikely Interpretations

## Conclusion

> For there will be a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching. Instead, following their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves, because they have an insatiable curiosity to hear **new things**. 4 And they will turn away from hearing the truth, but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths. (The NET Bible: Full Notes Edition, 2019, 2Tim. 4:3-4).

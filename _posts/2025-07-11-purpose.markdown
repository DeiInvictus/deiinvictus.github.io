<!-- <p style="text-indent:2em;">While God has used the combination of <a class="alterlink" href="https://deiinvictus.com/posts/autodidacticism/">autodidacticism</a> and formal education simultaneously for powerful effect,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> the <a class="alterlink" href="https://deiinvictus.com/posts/solitude/">solitude</a> of asceticism has also been used to transform and prepare Christians for extraordinary purposes.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup></p> -->

<p style="text-indent:2em;">
For the longest time as a youth, I grappled with my purpose&mdash;my raison d’être (i.e., my reason for being).<sup style="font-weight:bold;">1</sup> But in His sovereign design the Lord led me into twenty years of ascetic <a class="alterlink" href="https://deiinvictus.com/posts/autodidacticism/">autodidacticism</a> where I taught myself a myriad of sciences. There was a time during my journey when Satan sought to deceive me away from God's providential plan.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup> It was a time of darkness&mdash;to bring about my ruin&mdash;but God came for me in that brief darkness and drew me out by Name.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> Just before I stumbled through a door I believed was meant for me, He closed it, steering me back onto the course shaped by years of His preparation. Now He has restored me to my true calling, guiding me from a posture of holy separation into a sphere of purposeful influence. After decades of steadfast trust, God’s will in my life has been revealed&mdash;and now that His purpose is made manifest, my enemies rage and <a class="alterlink" href="https://deiinvictus.com/posts/envy/">seethe</a> with deep hatred and hostility. They harbor animosity towards my friend for his investment in me, and they resent my father for the educational opportunities he afforded me. Their disdain stems from a deep-seated hatred for the blessings that God has bestowed upon my life. In their bitterness, they express their frustration through gritted teeth, unable to thwart a providence that remains beyond their control. God, in His wisdom, used their unwitting actions against them, leading to their defeat and frustration.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">4,5</sup> The will of God will be accomplished in my life, both in this world and the next.</p>


> Let’s turn in our Bibles to Ephesians. **Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God**: Now, if you were writing this epistle, take out the name “Paul,” insert your name, and then whatever it is that you are. ... it is a mistake to try to be something that God hasn’t called you to be&mdash;something that God hasn’t **equipped** you for. ... **Whatever God has called you to be&mdash;and equipped you to be&mdash;is God’s highest calling for your life**... So Paul is just declaring his own card: **“What I am, I am by the will of God.”** That’s what’s important (Smith, 1979–1985; 0:00-2:52).

<p style="text-indent:2em;">
Forged by the weight of countless years and tempered in the fires of perseverance, I have come to embrace the gifts God has <strong>equipped</strong> me with in the sciences&mdash;gifts that culminated in my induction into the honors society. By His grace I’ve been blessed with <a class="alterlink" href="https://deiinvictus.com/posts/poor/">spiritual riches</a>, and in the fiery crucible of <a class="alterlink" href="https://deiinvictus.com/posts/solitude/">solitude</a>, God shaped me to reclaim that which darkness once stole. God often harnesses both <a class="alterlink" href="https://deiinvictus.com/posts/autodidacticism/">autodidacticism</a> and formal education simultaneously for powerful effect,<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> He likewise employs <a class="alterlink" href="https://deiinvictus.com/posts/solitude/">solitude</a> as a way to refine and ready believers for unique circumstances.<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> These periods of seclusion are often of <strong>limited duration</strong>&mdash;as exemplified by Moses’ forty years in the wilderness (Ac. 7:30). I invite you to join me in <a class="alterlink" href="https://deiinvictus.com/posts/campaign-for-science-and-progress/">reclaiming the sciences</a>&mdash;uniting humanity against the forces of darkness and guiding all into the light of knowledge and salvation. Reflecting on Christ’s words makes the reason clear&mdash;our purpose is to effect change:</p>

> I’m not asking you to take them out of the world, but to keep them safe from the evil one. They do not belong to this world any more than I do. Make them holy by your truth; teach them your word, which is truth. Just as you sent me into the world, I am sending them into the world (New Living Translation, 2015, John 17:15-18)

I really do not like the phrase, “Oh, he’s following the highest calling of God; he’s gone into the ministry.” The ministry is not the highest calling of God. “Oh, he’s following the highest calling of God; he’s a missionary.” That’s not the highest calling of God. **Whatever God has called you to be&mdash;and equipped you to be&mdash;is God’s highest calling for your life**, and you don’t need to feel like a second-rate heavenly citizen just because you have a job at a service station, you’re a secretary, or you’re blessed by God with the privilege of being a housewife. Whatever it is that God has called you to be is the highest calling of God for your life, and we should be enjoying rather than feeling guilty: “Oh my, you know I’m not in the ministry; I should be in the ministry; I have to work at this job and all.” Hey, be grateful that God has spared you a lot of the pain, deprivation, and grief that ministers often have to go through. So Paul is just declaring his own card: **“What I am, I am by the will of God.”** That’s what’s important (Smith, 1979–1985; C2000 Ephesians 1). -->

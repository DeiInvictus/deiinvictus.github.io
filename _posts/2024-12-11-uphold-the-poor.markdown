## Believers who are poor or in lowly circumstances should glory that God has made them spiritually rich, exalting them to a high position. God has honored them.

<!-- God Has Told The Poor To Boast That Their Faith & Spiritual Standing Are Greater Than Those With Wealth -->

<!-- This happens because you don't understand the bible well enough to know that God doesn't look at things the way the world does. -->

## Many forget that Christ and the Apostles Suffered in Poverty

It's time for you to recognize that Christ (Mt 8:20) & the Apostles were poor, beaten, and were brutally treated and eventually murdered. If you flaunt your wealth in pride or believe in the false health & wealth prosperity Gospel, you are lost or being taken advantage of. This happens from a lack of understanding about biblical teaching, God does not look at things the way the world does (Isa 55:8-9; 1 Sam 16:7; James 4:4).

<!-- were poor and did not want us to pursue material wealth. -->

### Christ Jesus Suffered in Poverty, Was Brutally Beaten, and Crucified

> And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head” (Matthew 8:20 ESV).

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> **He was despised and rejected by men,**<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">**a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;**</span><br>
**and as one from whom men hide their faces**<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">**he was despised, and we esteemed him not** (Isaiah 53:3 ESV)</span>

### The Apostles Suffered in Poverty, Were Brutally Beaten, and Eventually Killed

> Five different times the Jewish leaders gave me thirty-nine lashes. 25 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. Once I spent a whole night and a day adrift at sea. 26 I have traveled on many long journeys. I have faced danger from rivers and from robbers. I have faced danger from my own people, the Jews, as well as from the Gentiles. I have faced danger in the cities, in the deserts, and on the seas. <span style="font-weight:bold;">And I have faced danger from men who claim to be believers but are not.</span> 27 I have worked hard and long, enduring many sleepless nights. I have been hungry and thirsty and have often gone without food. I have shivered in the cold, without enough clothing to keep me warm (2 Corinthians 11:24-27 NLT).

<!-- So, will you listen? Lean not unto your own understanding (Proverbs 3:5), just listen to Christ (Lk 13:3; Mt 4:17). It's time to stop fighting against scripture. Surrender to the Lord of Destiny (Ac 17:30; 1Jn 2:4). -->

### John the Baptist Lived off of Locusts In The Desert and Was Beheaded For Telling People to Turn From Their Sins

> Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey (Matt. 3:4).

### The Poor Will Be Vindicated by God Himself!

What they do to you, they do to Christ!

> And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’ (Matt. 25:40).

> For he who avenges blood is mindful of them; he does not forget the cry of the afflicted (Psalm 9:12).

Your vindication is coming.

> JAMES—NOTE ON 1:9–11 The Place of Rich and Poor before God. Both poverty and riches bring enormous pressure on a person to focus on the world rather than on Christ. Thus James exhorts the poor to boast (or glory) in their high status in Christ. **The lowly brother will be exalted or vindicated by God.** In contrast, James exhorts the rich to boast in their humiliation, (1) by realizing that **their wealth is temporary and that it brings them no advantage before God**, and (2) by identifying with the poor in their affliction. The church is to be a “countercultural” community, which reverses the values of the world (cf. 2:2–4). Given the context, James seems to be saying that the challenges of poverty and wealth may be one of the greatest “trials” for Christians, as would be suggested by his immediate emphasis (see 1:12) on the “blessed” status of those who remain “steadfast under trial.” James also echoes Jesus’ warning that **“You cannot serve God and money”** (Matt. 6:24).

## Christ Does Not Want the Poor to Worry About Anything

> “That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life—whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn’t life more than food, and your body more than clothing? 26 Look at the birds. They don’t plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren’t you far more valuable to him than they are? 27 Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?
>
> 28 “And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don’t work or make their clothing, 29 yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are (Matt. 6:25-29 NLT).

The Bible shows however, that they are already rich! They are Kings and priests unto the Lord.

> and has made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. &mdash; Revelation 1:6 NKJV

Do not fear for you are of more value than many sparrows.

> Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. 30 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Fear not, therefore; **you are of more value than many sparrows**. &mdash; Matthew 10:29-31 ESV

## Listen To The Story Of The Poor Wise Man

When people are puffed up in foolish pride over the poor, they display their ignorance and sign their fate. This happens from a lack of understanding about biblical teaching, God does not look at things the way the world does (Isa 55:8-9; 1 Sam 16:7; James 4:4). It is the poor that are wise!

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth, and it is a great burden to me: <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> There was once a small city with a few men in it, and a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> However, a poor but wise man lived in the city, and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:crimson;">he could have delivered the city by his wisdom, but no one listened to that poor man</span>. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> So I concluded that wisdom is better than might, but <span style="font-weight:bold;color:crimson;">a poor man’s wisdom is despised</span>; no one ever listens to his advice. &mdash; Ecclesiastes 9:13-16 NET
>>
>> g. Ecclesiastes 9:15 **tn** Or “he delivered.” The verb וּמִלַּט (umillat, from מָלַט, malat, “to deliver”) is functioning either in an indicative sense (past definite action: “he delivered”) or in a modal sense (past potential: “he could have delivered”). The literal meaning of זָכַר (zakhar, “to remember”) in the following line harmonizes with the indicative: “but no one remembered that poor man [afterward].” However, the modal is supported by v. 16: “A poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.” This approach must nuance זָכַר (“to remember”) as “[no one] listened to [that poor man].” Most translations favor the indicative approach: “he delivered” or “he saved” (KJV, RSV, NRSV, NAB, ASV, NASB, MLB, NIV); however, some adopt the modal nuance: “he might have saved” (NEB, NJPS, NASB margin).

Personally, I enjoy the story with the modal nuance. Without the modal nuance the story would say that he saved the city but that no one remembered him, whereas with the modal nuance it says, that he could have saved the city but they were destroyed for not listening. It seems like there is more consequence for ignoring wisdom with this approach, but either way, the wisdom of the poor is despised by the world. What do you think will happen if you keep disregarding his message (Proverbs 29:1 NET)?

<!-- You may have read my article on the [poor wise man](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/true-riches/), but there is another element to poverty. Sometimes it's God's way of giving someone wisdom for a unique task. -->


<!-- There is a false teaching common among the many health and wealth prosperity charlatans and heretics that teach the false prosperity gospel. These wolves (Mt 7:15) are [cursed](https://sevenshepherd.github.io/the-gospel-and-the-divine-curse/) (Gal 1:8-9 NIV). True poverty can be a gift in the sense that it gives us wisdom through trial. -->

## Final Words

Society pressures, degrades, and humiliates the poor out of ignorance and satanic influence. Do not pay attention to the oppression, marginalization and persecution of the ignorant, spiritually poor, unwise, and hellbound. These material things are absolutely meaningless and temporary!

> Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death (Proverbs 11:4).

he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and no beauty that we should desire him.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">3</sup> **He was despised and rejected by men,**<br>

yet we esteemed him stricken,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">smitten by God, and afflicted.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">5</sup> But he was pierced for our transgressions;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">he was crushed for our iniquities;</span><br>
upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,<br>

<sup style="font-weight:bold;">6</sup> All we like sheep have gone astray;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">we have turned—every one—to his own way;</span><br>

<sup style="font-weight:bold;">7</sup> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">yet he opened not his mouth;</span><br>
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">so he opened not his mouth.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">8</sup> By oppression and judgment he was taken away;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and as for his generation, who considered</span><br>
that he was cut off out of the land of the living,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">stricken for the transgression of my people?</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">9</sup> And they made his grave with the wicked<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and with a rich man in his death,</span><br>
although he had done no violence,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and there was no deceit in his mouth.</span><br>

<sup style="font-weight:bold;">10</sup> **Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him;** (cf. Ac 2:23)<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">he has put him to grief;</span><br>
when his soul makes an offering for guilt,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days;</span><br>
the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.<br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">11</sup> Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;<br>
by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">make many to be accounted righteous,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and he shall bear their iniquities.</span><br>
<sup style="font-weight:bold;">12</sup> Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and he shall divide the spoil with the strong,</span><br>
because he poured out his soul to death<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and was numbered with the transgressors;</span><br>
yet he bore the sin of many,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">and makes intercession for the transgressors.</span><br>

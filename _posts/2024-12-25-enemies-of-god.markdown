## ☠️ I. Sociological & Theological Cults
<a name="sociological-theological" href="#contents" style="font-size:2.1em;"></a>

The following definitions clarify the differences between cults and heretical sects. A cult is identified by both sociological and theological criteria (e.g., Jim Jones, David Koresh, Marshall Applewhite, David Berg, etc.), whereas a heretical sect is defined solely in the theological sense (e.g., Witnesses, Mormons, etc.). Given the general familiarity with the concept of a cult, this article seeks to deconstruct heretical sects and expose their insidious, deceitful, and nefarious false teachings. Generally, a group is exempt from the theological classification if it is both creedal and confessional, so we will be examining groups in rebellion against the Church and Church History.

> **The sociological sense** is used when discussing behavior or other sociological aspects: a group or movement may be a cult if it acts in ways that are illegal or otherwise unacceptable in a civilized society [(&ldquo;Cult Definition,&rdquo; 1996)](https://www.cultdefinition.com/#cult-meanings-of-the-term-vary).

> **The theological sense** is used when discussing major religious differences: a group or movement is theologically a cult if it identifies itself as belonging to a mainstream, recognized religion — and yet rejects or otherwise violates one or more of the central, essential teachings of that religion [(&ldquo;Cult Definition,&rdquo; 1996)](https://www.cultdefinition.com/#cult-meanings-of-the-term-vary).

## I. Sociological & Theological Cults
<a name="sociological-theological" href="#" style="font-size:2.1em;"></a>

The following definitions clarify the differences between cults and heretical sects. A cult is identified by **both sociological and theological criteria** (e.g., Jim Jones of People's Temple, David Koresh of Branch Davidians, Marshall Applewhite of Heaven's Gate, David Berg of Children of God, etc.), whereas **a heretical sect is defined solely in the theological sense** (e.g., Charles Taze Russell of the Witnesses, Joseph Smith of Mormonism, etc.).

> **The sociological sense** is used when discussing behavior or other sociological aspects: a group or movement may be a cult if it acts in ways that are illegal or otherwise unacceptable in a civilized society (Apologetics Index, 1996).

> **The theological sense** is used when discussing major religious differences: a group or movement is theologically a cult if it identifies itself as belonging to a mainstream, recognized religion — and yet rejects or otherwise violates one or more of the central, essential teachings of that religion (Apologetics Index, 1996).


## II. Heretical Sects (Theological Cults)

<!-- insidious, deceitful, and nefarious -->

Given the general familiarity with the concept of a cult, this article seeks to specifically deconstruct heretical sects (theological cults) and expose their subtly deceptive and nuanced false teachings. Generally, **a group is exempt from the theological classification if it is both creedal and confessional**, so we will be examining groups in rebellion against the Church and Church History.

### 2.1 Antinomian Heretical Sects

#### 2.1.1 Dualistic Antinomianism (e.g. Gnosticism)

> **Dualistic antinomianism** appears in the Gnostic heretics against whom Jude and Peter wrote (Jude 4–19; 2 Pet. 2). This view sees salvation as for the soul only, and bodily behaviour as irrelevant both to God’s interest and to the soul’s health, so one may behave riotously and it will not matter (Packer, 2020, p. 192).

#### 2.1.2 Spirit Centered Antinomianism

> **Spirit-centred antinomianism** puts such trust in the Holy Spirit’s inward prompting as to deny any need to be taught by the law how to live. Freedom from the law as a way of salvation is assumed to bring with it freedom from the law as a guide to conduct. In the first hundred and fifty years of the Reformation era this kind of antinomianism often threatened, and Paul’s insistence that a truly spiritual person acknowledges the authority of God’s Word through Christ’s apostles (1 Cor. 14:37; cf. 7:40) suggests that the Spirit-obsessed Corinthian church was in the grip of the same mindset (Packer, 2020, pp. 192-3).

#### 2.1.3 Christ-Centered Antinomianism (e.g. Hyper-Grace)

> **Christ-centred antinomianism** argues that God sees no sin in believers, because they are in Christ, who kept the law for them, and therefore what they actually do makes no difference, provided that they keep believing. **But 1 John 1:8 – 2:1 (expounding 1Jn 1:7) and 1Jn 3:4–10 point in a different direction, showing that <span style="color:Crimson;">it is not possible to be in Christ and at the same time to embrace sin as a way of life</span>** (Packer, 2020, p. 193).

#### 2.1.4 Dispensational Antinomianism

> **Dispensational antinomianism** holds that keeping the moral law is at no stage necessary for Christians, since we live under a dispensation of grace, not of law. Romans 3:31 and 1 Corinthians 6:9–11 clearly show, however, that law-keeping is a continuing obligation for Christians. ‘I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law,’ says Paul (1 Cor. 9:21) (Packer, 2020, p. 193).

ℹ️ Disclaimer: We are no longer under the law (Ro 6:1-2,14-15; Gal 3:23-25; Gal 5:18; Col 2:14), but we still uphold the law (Romans 3:31). For teachers who understand the scriptures and still teach Dispensationalism without the antinomianism: Chuck Smith, Ron Rhodes, and MacArthur are safe.

#### 2.1.5 Dialectical Antinomianism

> **Dialectical antinomianism**, as in Barth and Brunner, denies that biblical law is God’s direct command and affirms that the Bible’s imperative statements trigger the Word of the Spirit, which when it comes may or may not correspond exactly to what is written. The inadequacy of the neoorthodox view of biblical authority, which explains the inspiration of Scripture in terms of the Bible’s instrumentality as a channel for God’s present-day utterances to his people, is evident here (Packer, 2020, p. 193).

#### 2.1.6 Situationist Antinomianism

> **Situationist antinomianism** says that a motive and intention of love is all that God now requires of Christians, and the commands of the Decalogue and other ethical parts of Scripture, for all that they are ascribed to God directly, are mere rules of thumb for loving, rules that love may at any time disregard. But Romans 13:8–10, to which this view appeals, teaches that without love as a motive these specific commands cannot be fulfilled. Once more an unacceptably weak view of Scripture surfaces (Packer, 2020, p. 193).

Christians have established a formidable presence in the realm of science, a triumph that we must ardently defend and perpetuate for future generations. From Newton, Leibniz, and Maxwell to Kistiakowsky and Polkinghorne, [Protestants have dominated the sciences as well as the Nobel Prize for hundreds of years](https://deiinvictus.com/posts/protestants-dominate-the-sciences/). This excellence can also be traced to the ancient past. It is up to us to carry on this legacy!

### Moses' Egyptian Education

Moses' secular education in the Egyptian court equipped him with skills in leadership, writing, and strategic thinking that were vital for the future role in leading the israelites.

> So Moses was trained in **all the wisdom of the Egyptians** and was powerful in his words and deeds (NET Bible, 2019, Acts 7:22).

### Daniel's Babylonian Education

Daniel and his friends were educated in the language and literature of the Babylonians. God placed Daniel in a setting that emphasized learning beyond religious instruction, giving him access to knowledge that would prepare him for a prominent role in a secular government while maintaining his faith.

> “Select only strong, healthy, and good-looking young men,” he said. **“Make sure they are well versed in every branch of learning, are gifted with knowledge and good judgment**, and are suited to serve in the royal palace. Train these young men in the language and literature of Babylon.[a]” 5 The king assigned them a daily ration of food and wine from his own kitchens. They were to be trained for three years, and then they would enter the royal service (New Living Translation, 2015, Dan. 1:4-5).

### Crystallized Intelligence Never Fades

<!-- While age related changes may effect your fluid intelligence (e.g., inductive reasoning and spatial orientation), your crystallized intelligence (e.g., numerical ability, verbal ability) remains intact your entire life, well into one's 80s. In a sense, by concentrating on STEM or writing fields  you can ensure your intellectual skills remain enduring throughout your lifetime. This phenomenon explains why many scientists continue to contribute to their fields well into old age. -->

Although age-related changes may impact your fluid intelligence, such as inductive reasoning and spatial orientation, your **crystallized intelligence, which encompasses numerical and verbal abilities, remains stable throughout your life, often well into your 80s.** By focusing on fields such as STEM or writing, you can help ensure that your intellectual skills endure over time. This phenomenon accounts for why many scientists continue to make significant contributions to their disciplines well into their later years.

### Your Age Does Not Matter

Regardless of your age, pursuing an education is a worthwhile endeavor that can enable you to contribute meaningfully to the Christian community. For instance, my mathematics professor earned his Master's degree at the age of 60 and began teaching our class. What is holding you back? The misconception that college is solely for the young often stems from a lack of understanding, as many classes are populated by individuals from diverse age groups.

> Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death (Einstein).

### Autodidactism is Real but Unrecognized

<small>See [my article on autodidactism](https://deiinvictus.com/posts/autodidactism/).</small>

<!-- From Galileo Galilei, who challenged the geocentric view of the universe, to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a mathematical autodidact who co-invented calculus, the spirit of autodidactism has driven some of history’s greatest minds. Michael Faraday, a self-taught scientist, revolutionized our understanding of electromagnetism, while Nikola Tesla, who never graduated from university, established the foundation for modern electrical systems through his innovative ideas. Similarly, Srinivasa Ramanujan, despite limited formal education, made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics. Yet despite their monumental achievements, many of these brilliant minds faced significant struggles. Galileo, though initially celebrated, endured persecution for his scientific beliefs and financial strain while supporting his family. Leibniz, despite his intellectual prowess, struggled with recognition and died in obscurity. Faraday, who rose from humble beginnings, lived modestly, declining wealth and honors to focus solely on his work. Tesla, known for his groundbreaking inventions, faced financial hardship later in life and died penniless in the Hotel New Yorker. Ramanujan, despite his extraordinary mathematical talent, lived in poverty for much of his life in India and fought for recognition until his later years. These narratives exemplify how self-directed learning can lead to extraordinary achievements while also serving as poignant reminders of the harsh realities often faced by those who completely embrace autodidactism. -->

The educational philosophy of [autodidactism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_autodidacts) is a very real and richly rewarding reality that will never be fully recognized by society. Unfortunately, society often struggles to grasp concepts such as autodidactism; not only may one face skepticism during the hiring process, but there can also be social ostracism from peers. Those of us who are aware recognize that knowledge can be acquired through self-study, yet we eventually realize that formal validation is often the only pathway to acceptance within a society governed by gatekeepers. It's important to recognize that not everyone approaches self-directed learning with the same level of diligence, and there is often no quick or straightforward way for others to fully assess your abilities. The scriptures indicate that this phenomenon has persisted since the dawn of time and will continue to inflict harm on self-directed learners, as humanity has opted for a misguided path characterized by crass materialism and arrogance. Save yourself time and effort and realize that, **unlike** justification, society is meritocratic, status-oriented, and will not take you at your word:

> This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth, and it is a great burden to me: There was once a small city with a few men in it, and a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it. However, a poor but wise man lived in the city, and <span style="font-weight:bold;">he could have delivered the city by his wisdom, but no one listened to that poor man</span>. So I concluded that wisdom is better than might, but <span style="font-weight:bold;">a poor man’s wisdom is despised</span>; no one ever listens to his advice (NET Bible, 2019, Ecc. 9:13-16 NET).

<!-- In my youth, I independently taught myself how to program to an advanced degree, becoming proficient in a handful of languages before ultimately choosing Python as my preferred medium for personal projects. Unfortunately, society often struggles to grasp concepts such as autodidactism; not only may one face skepticism during the hiring process, but there can also be social ostracism from peers. Those of us who are aware recognize that knowledge can be acquired through self-study, yet we eventually realize that formal validation is often the only pathway to acceptance within a society governed by gatekeepers. It's important to recognize that not everyone approaches self-directed learning with the same level of diligence, and there is often no quick or straightforward way for others to fully assess your abilities. Save yourself time and effort and realize that, **unlike** justification, society is meritocratic, status-oriented, and will not take you at your word. -->

<!-- >>
>> g. Ecclesiastes 9:15 NET **tn** Or “he delivered.” The verb וּמִלַּט (umillat, from מָלַט, malat, “to deliver”) is functioning either in an indicative sense (past definite action: “he delivered”) or in a modal sense (past potential: “he could have delivered”). The literal meaning of זָכַר (zakhar, “to remember”) in the following line harmonizes with the indicative: “but no one remembered that poor man [afterward].” However, the modal is supported by v. 16: “A poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.” This approach must nuance זָכַר (“to remember”) as “[no one] listened to [that poor man].” Most translations favor the indicative approach: “he delivered” or “he saved” (KJV, RSV, NRSV, NAB, ASV, NASB, MLB, NIV); however, some adopt the modal nuance: “he might have saved” (NEB, NJPS, NASB margin). -->

<!-- The Apostle James also teaches that we justify ourselves "in the sight of men" by our good works and that these are **evidence** of genuine faith (Jas. 2:14-27; cf. 1Jn 2:3-4; 3:9). Logically, if we are attempting to impart knowledge or be taken seriously, we need to show people what we are capable of. -->

<!-- When I was young I taught myself how to program to an advanced level. I could program in multiple languages but I eventually came to settle on Python for recreation. Society doesn't understand concepts such as these very well, not only will you not be taken seriously during the hiring process, but you will be persecuted by your peers. Those of us who know, understand that one can learn anything from books, but eventually we all come to the understanding that proving ourselves formally is the only way to be accepted into a society of gatekeepers. -->

### Are You Making Every Effort?

If you're not getting your education, then **you are not making every effort**, nor are you presenting yourself as a proven worker unto God. This is especially true for anyone who intends to teach biblical doctrine. Never make an uneducated teacher your guide; that is the epitome of the blind leading the blind. Do not be fearful of intellectual hard labor.

> Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately (NET Bible, 2019, 2Tim. 2:15).

### The Uneducated Twist the Scriptures to Their Own Destruction

The teachings of the untaught are often heretical and they fall easily into false doctrines. Many such people have created their own theologies that breed hypocrisy and ignorance, endangering the lives of innocent children.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> He writes about ·this <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[<sup>L</sup> these things]</span> in all his letters. Some things in Paul’s letters are hard to understand, and people who are ·ignorant <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[untaught]</span> and ·weak in faith <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[unstable]</span> ·explain these things falsely <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[<sup>L</sup> twist/distort them]</span>. They also ·falsely explain <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[<sup>L</sup> twist; distort]</span> the other Scriptures, ·but they are destroying themselves by doing this <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[or which will lead to their destruction]</span> (Expanded Bible, 2011, 2Pet. 3:16).


### Beware the Indoctrination of Seminaries!

Theological institutions, particularly those that are overly insular, often prioritize indoctrination over genuine education. Each seminary tends to promote its own specific theological perspective, which can foster a disconnect from reality and hinder one's capacity to effectively address scriptural issues. In contrast, the Bible advocates for active engagement with the world while upholding one's faith.

> I’m not asking you to take them out of the world, but to keep them safe from the evil one. They do not belong to this world any more than I do. Make them holy by your truth; teach them your word, which is truth. Just as you sent me into the world, I am sending them into the world (New Living Translation, 2015, John 17:15-18).

Paul emphasizes unity in Christ rather than division by allegiance to specific human leaders. If you label yourselves with Catholicism (of the Pope), **Luther**anism (of Martin Luther), **Calvin**ism (of John Calvin), **Arminian**ism (of Jacobus Arminius), **Wesley**anism (of John Wesley), **Amyra**ldism (of Moses Amyraut), **Mol**inism (Luis de Molina), **Chafer**anism (of Lewis Sperry Chafer), you are going directly against the word of God and **your doctrine is not sound**. The Bible warns that some of these people **may** have created divisions because they are devoid of the spirit:

> "What I mean is that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.” Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" (ESV Study Bible, 2008, 1Cor. 1:12-13)

<!-- > These people are the ones who are creating divisions among you. They follow their natural instincts because **they do not have God’s Spirit in them** (New Living Translation, 2015, Jude 19). -->

<!-- Attend a reputable and accredited in-state university with proctoring; this will bolster your credibility and ensure that your efforts are recognized and respected. No one will be able to dismiss you then and God will be able to use you as an unstoppable force. I recommend something in STEM or Biblical Language Scholarship. Avoid Underwater basketweaving degrees such as theology. -->

Avoid pursuing a career as a theologian from a seminary, as many lack the necessary authority or comprehensive education regarding biblical texts. This has led to the emergence of various sects, often propagated by individuals with insufficient understanding or critical thinking skills (1John 2:27 ESV; cf. John 15:4-5 ESV).

### Sharpen Your Ax!

Many people are content to walk around with a very dull ax, this should not be so! [Research shows](https://youtu.be/GWSZ1DKjNzY) that you can change your intelligence through study, and the Bible encourages that you do so.

> Using a dull ax requires great strength, so sharpen the blade. That’s the value of wisdom; it helps you succeed. (New Living Translation, 2015, Ecc. 10:10)

> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Hosea 4:6).

### Recommendations

Enrolling in a reputable and **regionally accredited in-state college** to complete your basics and then transfer to a university, will enhance your credibility and ensure that your efforts are acknowledged and respected. This way, you will be less likely to be dismissed, and God can utilize you as a powerful force for good. **I recommend pursuing a degree in STEM; fields such as Physics, Mathematics, Engineering, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Biochemistry are excellent options.** I lead by example, having achieved a place on the President's List in Physics.

> Wisdom is supreme—so acquire wisdom, and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding! (NET Bible, 2019, Proverbs 4:7).

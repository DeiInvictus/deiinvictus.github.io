Any intelligent examination of the Bible leads to a belief in the doctrine of election. As Articulated by Jesus in the book of Matthew:

> **For many are called, but few are chosen.**‚Äù &mdash; Jesus in Matthew 22:14 (cf. Acts 13:48,2:23; Mt 22:14; Eph 1:4,11; Jn 15:16,18-19; Jn 6:44,65; Ro 8:29-30; 9:11-16; 1Pe 1:2; 2 Pe 1:10; Re 13:8,17:8; Lk 24:45+1Cor 2:14; Jn 17:9, and Ro 10:9+1Cor 12:3+Lk 6:46)

<!-- Let's explore the various concepts of predestination, briefly summarized:

- Double Predestination: &ldquo;God cast the die, and some of you are destined to lose the game.&rdquo;
- Single Unconditional Election: &ldquo;Some of you are foreordained to come to faith; the rest have condemned themselves to hell.&rdquo;
- Conditonal Election (double foreknowledge): &ldquo;The only way to find out if you were elected before time is to come to genuine faith.&rdquo;

Different types of Free Will:

- Newtonian Determinism: ‚ÄúEvery choice I make is but a cog in the grand machine of fate, where my actions are predetermined by the unyielding laws of nature, leaving no room for true freedom.‚Äù
- Freedom of Inclination: I am free to follow my desires, yet those desires shape the path I take toward my ultimate destiny.
- Compatibilism: My choices are both free and determined; I navigate the course of my life within the framework of divine sovereignty
  - My choices are genuine and meaningful, existing within the framework of God‚Äôs sovereign plan, where divine foreordination and human responsibility harmoniously coexist.
- Molinism: In the divine tapestry of time, I am granted the freedom to choose, while God‚Äôs perfect foreknowledge weaves my decisions into His sovereign plan.
- Libertarian Free Will: &ldquo;I possess the power to choose heaven, yet I can also forfeit my salvation and shatter my seal.&rdquo; -->


## I. <a name="newtonian-determinism" href="#Contents">ü§ñ Determinism & Fatalism</a>

<sup>üî¥ Debunked by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.</sup>

Many of history's most brilliant thinkers, including both **Newton and Einstein**, subscribed to the philosophy of determinism. This view holds that all events, including human actions, are determined by preceding events in accordance with the laws of nature. Free will is an illusion, and thus, moral responsibility is also negated. However, this understanding was fundamentally shaken by the advent of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

> Newtonian Determinism says that the universe is a clock, a gigantic clock that‚Äôs wound up in the beginning of time and has been ticking ever since according to Newton‚Äôs laws of motion. So what you‚Äôre going to eat 10 years from now on January 1st has already been fixed. It‚Äôs already known using Newton‚Äôs laws of motion. Einstein believed in that. Einstein was a determinist.
>
> Does that mean that a murderer, this horrible mass murderer isn‚Äôt really guilty of his works because he was already preordained billions of years ago? Einstein said well yeah, in some sense that‚Äôs true that even mass murderers were predetermined, but he said, they should still be placed in jail ... (Kaku, 2011).<sup>1</sup>

Fatalism suggests that events are predetermined and inevitable, regardless of human actions. It often implies a sense of resignation to fate, where individuals believe that they cannot change the outcome of events.

<!-- > fatalism, the attitude of mind which accepts whatever happens as having been bound or decreed to happen. Such acceptance may be taken to imply belief in a binding or decreeing agent. The development of this implication can be found in ancient Greek and Roman mythology, with its personification of Fate, and in Norse mythology with the Norns.
> -->

> Later doctrines of fatalism may be described loosely as synonymous with determinism, but it is useful to make a distinction. Whereas determinism can be represented as compatible with moral responsibility, fatalism properly understood would reduce practical ethics to nothing but the advice that humans should resign themselves indifferently to the course of events. Strict fatalism, therefore, is not to be sought in the major Christian controversies arising from differences between Augustinian and Pelagian, semi-Pelagian, or Molinist doctrine on free will, on grace, and on predestination. Among Christians, the Quietists, with their uncritical reliance on inspiration, may be regarded as having approached more closely to the fatalistic norm of behaviour than any of the commonly recognized partisans of determinism, such as Calvinists or Jansenists (Britannica, 2017, para. 2).

### 1.1 <a href="#Contents" name="double-predestination">Double Predestination</a>

<sup>üî¥ Debunked by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.</sup>

Individuals who adhere to the doctrine of double predestination can be categorized within determinism. This doctrine asserts that God sovereignly determines both the election of individuals to salvation **and their reprobation** to damnation prior to their existence.

> The dreadful error of hyper-Calvinism is that it involves God in coercing sin. **This does radical violence to the integrity of God‚Äôs character**. &mdash; [Dr. R. C. Sproul (Ph.D., Whitefield)](https://youtu.be/-HMb9YjRq8Q), "Chosen by God," Ch. 7. Sproul was a devout <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#FBB917;">5-point Scholastic Calvinist</span>

> I cannot image a more ready instrument in the hands of Satan for the ruin of souls than a minister who tells sinners it is not their duty to repent of their sins [and] who has the arrogance to call himself a gospel minister, while he teaches that God hates some men infinitely and unchangeably for no reason whatever but simply because he chooses to do so. O my brethren! may the Lord save you from the charmer, and keep you ever deaf to the voice of error. &mdash; In Murray, Spurgeon v. Hyper-Calvinism, 155‚Äì56.

Ron Rhodes Against Double Predestination

> **3\.** ***Universal, divine, determinism makes God the author of sin and precludes human responsibility.*** In contrast to the Molinist view, on the deterministic view even the movement of the human will is caused by God. God moves people to choose evil, and they cannot do otherwise. God determines their choices and makes them do wrong. If it is evil to make another person do wrong, then on this view God is not only the cause of sin and evil, but becomes evil Himself, which is absurd. By the same token, all human responsibility for sin has been removed. For our choices are not really up to us: God causes us to make them. We cannot be responsible for our actions, for nothing we think or do is up to us.

&mdash; [Molinism vs Calvinism](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/molinism-vs.-calvinism)

> ... In light of this, the use of this text to promote **‚Äúdouble predestination‚Äù seems completely wrong** &mdash; Dr. John C. Lennox (PhD, University of Cambridge; DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford; DSc, Cardiff University), *Determined to Believe?* p. 246.

> There are some who take these texts to mean that in eternity God mysteriously or even arbitrarily chose who was to be a vessel of wrath and who was to be a vessel of mercy; and that choice permanently and unconditionally fixes their destinies. There is a fundamental flaw in this reasoning, even apart from the fact that it makes no moral sense. **The flaw is to assume that, if someone is a vessel of wrath, they can never become a vessel of mercy.** But **that is false**, as Jeremiah‚Äôs use of the potter analogy indicates. **Paul was a vessel of wrath who became a vessel of mercy.** Also, in Ephesians, Paul describes the believers as having once been children of wrath, but because they had repented and trusted Christ as Saviour and Lord they had become vessels of mercy (see Ephesians 2:3‚Äì4) (Lennox, 2018, p. 272).<sup>1</sup>

### 1.2 <a href="#Contents" name="unconditional-single-election">Unconditional Single Election</a>

<sup>üü° Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle places significant strain on the concept of Freedom of Inclination.</sup>

In contrast to Reformed compatibilism, which advocates for unconditional single election in conjunction with free will, this perspective promotes unconditional single election alongside the concept of freedom of inclination. This distinction positions it within the determinist camp.

> The Roman and Arminian views posit sinful men and women as the ultimate determiners of their own salvation, whereas Augustinians and Reformed identify God as the ultimate and efficient cause of eternal blessedness. According to the former traditions, the distinction between the saved and the unsaved is grounded in the choice of the creature; according to the latter, the distinction is grounded in the good pleasure and will of God, however unclear the rationale thereof may be to us mortals. The weight of biblical and historical evidence rests in favor of a single unconditional election to life. This position holds that out of the mass of fallen and responsible humanity‚Äîfor reasons known to himself‚ÄîGod in grace chose some to be saved and to permit the others to persist in their sin. **Against the symmetrical view of Romanists and Arminians (double foreknowledge) and Hyper-Calvinists and Barthians (double predestination), <span style="color:ForestGreen">the biblical evidence leads us to posit an asymmetrical view of soteriological purpose‚Äînamely, unconditional election to life and conditional election to damnation</span>. When we speak about damnation, we mean that God predestines persons not to sin and disobedience but to the condemnation that issues from sin** (Demarest, 2006, pp. 135-138).<sup>1</sup>

<!-- > Concerning this doctrine of election to life, we concur with the carefully measured conclusion of Jewett, who wrote: ‚ÄúIn my judgment, this Augustinian approach reflects a much more impressive biblical and exegetical effort than does the Pelagian and Arminian view.‚Äù<sup>146</sup> We do not wish to blow the importance of this debated doctrine of predestination out of proportion. But neither do we neglect what is undoubtedly a significant biblical theme. The following section will discuss the practical relevance of the doctrine of election for the life of Christian believers (Demarest, 2006, pp. 135-138). -->

## II. <a name="indeterminism" href="#Contents">‚ò†Ô∏è Indeterminism & Libertarianism</a>

<sup>üü° Demonstrated as possible by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.</sup>

This view posits that not all events are determined by preceding causes, allowing for randomness or chance. Indeterminism opens the door for a form of free will, as it suggests that some events (including human decisions) can occur without being predetermined.

> ... Heisenberg then comes along and proposes the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and says: &ldquo;Nonsense. There is uncertainty. You don‚Äôt know where the electron is. It could be here, here or many places simultaneously.&rdquo; This of course Einstein hated because he said God doesn‚Äôt play dice with the universe. Well hey, get used to it. Einstein was wrong. God does play dice. Every time we look at an electron it moves. There is uncertainty with regards to the position of the electron.
>
> So what does that mean for free will? It means in some sense we do have some kind of free will. No one can determine your future events given your past history. There is always the wildcard. There is always the possibility of uncertainty in whatever we do.
>
> So when I look at myself in a mirror I say to myself what I'm looking at is not really me. It looks like me, but it‚Äôs not really me at all. It‚Äôs not me today now. It‚Äôs me a billionth of a second ago because it takes a billionth of a second for light to go from me to the mirror and back (Kaku, 2011, 0:42).<sup>1</sup>

> The fact that God knows possibilities, and all possibilities don't happen. tells you that God's foreknowledge of those possibilities did not result in the predestination of all those possibilities. foreknowledge and predestination are not inextricably linked, **foreknowledge does not necessitate predestination**. God knowing all things real and possible actually undermines that idea (Heiser, 2021, 0:48).<sup>2</sup>

### 3.1 <a name="libertarian-free-will" href="#Contents">Libertarian Free Will</a>

<sup>üî¥ Discredited by Scripture and the "intelligibility" objection.</sup>

Libertarianism extends this concept to an illogical extreme. For Christians, the difficulty presented by **libertarian free will** stems from its total disregard for God's sovereignty and its profound neglect of Scriptural teachings. Libertarianism contradicts Ephesians 1:13-14 by ignorantly asserting that individuals can nullify their own divine seal through the exercise of their free will, that they can essentially snatch themselves from God's hand (John 10:28-29), and that they somehow have the free will to overpower God himself (Romans 8:38-39).

> Libertarianism is vulnerable to what is called the ‚Äúintelligibility‚Äù objection, which points out that people can have no more control over a purely random action than they have over an action that is deterministically inevitable; in neither case does free will enter the picture. Hence, if human actions are indeterministic, free will does not exist. (Britannica, 2024, para. 5).

## III. <a name="compatibilism" href="#Contents">‚öñÔ∏è Theological Compatibilism</a>

<sup>üü¢ Highly likely accounting for God's sovereignty and free will via Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.</sup>

Compatibilism recognizes God's sovereignty alongside Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Compatibilism argues that determinism (God's sovereignty) and free will are not mutually exclusive, in other words, they exist at the same time. Compatibilists believe that individuals can be considered free in their choices, even if those choices are determined by prior causes. They redefine free will to fit within a deterministic framework, or in this context, free will is reconceptualized to align with God's sovereignty. **This is where you will find the world's brightest theologians and biblical language scholars.**

> I believe that **the doctrine of election is absolutely true** while at the same time it's true that human beings have a free will **this is an idea known as compatibilism** in theological circles (Rhodes, 2016, 1:58).

</small>

### 3.1 <a name="double-foreknowledge" href="#Contents">Double Foreknowledge</a>

Conditional Election, also known as the Wesleyan Foreknowledge view, can be interpreted as a variant of Compatibilism, as it posits that God predestines individuals based on His foreknowledge of their foreseen faith, even prior to their existence. The only way to know if you are one of the elect is to come to faith. Dr. Rhodes (2016) articulates their perspective as follows:

> Arminians will come in and say that God's predetermination or election is based on his foreknowledge, in other words, God looks down through the corridors of time and decides who's going to respond positively to the gospel and then he will elect those individuals to salvation ... (2:58).

Chuck Smith also taught the Wesleyan Foreknowledge view of election.

> **We believe that God chose the believer** before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4-6), and **based on His foreknowledge**, has **predestined the believer** to be conformed to the image of His Son (Romans 8:29-30). We believe that God offers salvation to all who will call on His name. Romans 10:13 says, &ldquo; For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; We also believe that God calls to Himself those who will believe in His Son, Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 1:9). However, the Bible also teaches that an invitation (or call) is given to all, but only a few accept it. We see this balance throughout scripture. Revelation 22:17 states, &ldquo;... And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&rdquo; 1 Peter 1:2 tells us we are, &ldquo;Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. ...&rdquo; Matthew 22:14 says, <span style="font-weight:bold;">&ldquo;For many are called, but few are chosen (elected).&rdquo;</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#3EA055;">God clearly does choose</span>, but man must also accept God's invitation to salvation (Smith, 2001, p. 10).<sup>1</sup>

### 3.2 <a name="asymmetrical-compatibilism" href="#Contents">Asymmetrical Compatibilism</a>

Reformed variants of Compatibilism assert a definitive emphasis on foreordination rather than foreknowledge. They maintain that we possess free will, but rather than associating it with a prescient foreknowledge, they align it with unconditional single election. While supralapsarian high-Calvinists advocate for a symmetrical double foreordination and Arminians support a symmetrical double prescient foreknowledge, this perspective asserts that foreordination applies solely to election, with foreknowledge pertaining to reprobation. The distinction between this asymmetry and that of infralapsarian orthodox Calvinists lies in the fact that this model contrasts God's sovereignty with free will, rather than with the freedom of inclination. In layman's terms, there's predestination and free will.

<!-- Whereas supralapsarian high-Calvinists believe in a symmetrical double foreordination, and the Arminians believe in a symmetrical double prescient foreknowledge, this view posits foreordination only in election and foreknowledge in reprobation. The difference between this asymmetry and that of the infralapsarian orthodox Calvinists is that this form of asymmetry is between God's sovereignty and free will instead of God's sovereignty and freedom of inclination. -->

> Arminians will come in and say that God's predetermination or election is based on his foreknowledge, in other words, God looks down through the corridors of time and decides who's going to respond positively to the gospel and then he will elect those individuals to salvation **the problem with that view is that the Bible doesn't indicate that God just knows things in advance but he actually determines things in advance he determines what will happen** (Rhodes, 2016, 2:58).<sup>1</sup>

> If what Carson means is that that John believes in both God‚Äôs sovereignty and human responsibility, and that both must be held equally firmly, however paradoxical the resulting tension may appear to us, then **that would be fine**.

## IV. <a name="conclusion" href="#Contents">‚öñÔ∏è Conclusion</a>

Both Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and, potentially, G√∂del's incompleteness theorems indicate that there are inherent limits to what can be known or measured in both physics and mathematics, thereby negating Newtonian determinism. Given that Scripture affirms God's absolute sovereignty while also holding individuals accountable for their actions, compatibilism emerges as the most logical conclusion.

> Chapter Three, GOD AS SOVEREIGN. ... Chance is excluded; and if here and there we read of something that might be considered a chance event, it is not really thought of apart from God's direction (1 Sam. 6.9; 20.26; 1 Kgs. 22.34; Ruth 2.3; 2 Chr. 18.33). Hence the lot is used to discover Yahweh's will, 'and is didactically recognised as under His control' (Prov. 16.33; cf. Josh. 7.16; 14.2; 18.6; 1 Sam. 10.19-21; Jonah 1.7). ... Human thoughts and decisions are often attributed directly to God's determining (e.g. 2 Sam. 24.1; Isa. 19.13f.; 37.7; Prov. 21.1; Ezra 1.1; 7.6, 27f.; Neh. 2.11f.). ... Examples are so numerous that only a few instances may be cited. Micaiah's description of the heavenly courts and the selection of a lying spirit whose success is guaranteed (1 Kgs. 22.19-22; 2 Chr. 18.18-22), the inciting of David to evil purpose (2 Sam. 24.1), the selling of Joseph into slavery (Gen. 50.20), the sending forth of evil spirits to their appointed tasks (e.g. Judg. 9.23ff.; 1 Sam. 16.14; 18.10), the prologue of Job, not to mention the specific remarks of the prophets (e.g. Does evil (rƒÅ'ƒÅh) befall a city, unless the LORD has done it?" Amos 3.6; cf. Isa. 14.24-7; 45.7), all clamour for attention. ... God is also said to control the minds of his people for good. Sometimes he is petitioned to do so. Such expressions are particularly common in the prophets who look forward to the new covenant (cf. Jer. 31.31-4; 32.40; Ezek. 11.19f.; 36.22ff.; Zeph. 3.9-13; etc.), but are certainly not restricted to such a framework (e.g. 1 Chr. 29.17-19). ... Yahweh is holy, sovereign, full of special regard for his elect, and personally ruling in the affairs of men. This view of God makes the perplexity of his people understandable when, from the human perspective, it appears that Yahweh has dealt harshly (Ruth 1.20f.), unfairly (Job 3ff.), or without due consideration of the wickedness of other men (Habbakuk; Ps. 73). It prompts a cry like that in Isaiah 63.17: 'O LORD, why dost thou make us err from thy ways, and harden our heart, so that we fear thee not? Return for the sake of thy servants, for the tribes of thy heritage. (Cf. also Isa. 64.76.). ... Concluding remarks: The idea that God really is the sovereign disposer of all is consistently woven into the fabric of the Old Testament, even if there is relatively infrequent explicit reflection on the sovereignty-responsibility tension. Taken as a whole, the all-embracing activity of the sovereign God in the Old Testament must be distinguished from deism, which cuts the world off from him; from cosmic dualism, which divides the control of the world between God and other(s); from determinism, which posits such a direct and rigid control, or such an impersonal one, that human responsibility is destroyed; from indeterminism and chance, which deny either the existence or the rationality of a sovereign God; and from pantheism, which virtually identifies God with the world ... (Carson, 2002, pp. 24-38).<sup>1</sup>

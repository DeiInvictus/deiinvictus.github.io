<!-- The LORD is my Shepherd—therefore I lack nothing. Anyone who insists otherwise betrays a faith too faint to believe Him -->

<!-- Believers Who Are Poor Are Blessed With Spiritual Riches. The Rich Are Spiritually Poor, Humiliated, And In a Lowly State. -->

<!-- —Believers in Poverty Should Glory in Their Spiritual Wealth, for God Has Elevated and Honored Them -->

<!-- ![poor-knight](/assets/poor-knight.png) -->

<!-- <sup>Ordo Dei Invictus&mdash;“Order of the Unconquered God”&mdash;is a noble chivalric brotherhood sworn to uplift the poor and defend the downtrodden with unwavering faith and steel-forged resolve.</sup> -->

## Believers who are poor or in lowly circumstances should glory that God has made them spiritually rich, exalting them to a high position. God has honored them.

<!-- Realize that you have been blessed with spiritual riches beyond the comprehension of those with materialistic gain. No amount of material possessions will be able to bridge the gap between them and you&mdash;no matter how foolish they make themselves appear by oppressing you with empty materialism. -->

The Poor Will Be Vindicated by God Himself!

> The Place of Rich and Poor before God. Both poverty and riches bring enormous pressure on a person to focus on the world rather than on Christ. Thus James exhorts the poor to boast (or glory) in their high status in Christ. **The lowly brother will be exalted or vindicated by God.** In contrast, James exhorts the rich to boast in their humiliation, (1) by realizing that **their wealth is temporary and that it brings them no advantage before God**, and (2) by identifying with the poor in their affliction. The church is to be a “countercultural” community, which reverses the values of the world (cf. 2:2–4). Given the context, James seems to be saying that the challenges of poverty and wealth may be one of the greatest “trials” for Christians, as would be suggested by his immediate emphasis (see 1:12) on the “blessed” status of those who remain “steadfast under trial.” James also echoes Jesus’ warning that **“You cannot serve God and money”** (ESV Study Bible, 2008, James 1:9-11 ESV).

> Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Proverbs 11:4).


<!-- ## Those Who Preach Christ Yet Crush the Poor Are No Christians at All but Children of the Devil&mdash;Their Faith a Hollow Boast Masking Ruthless Unbelief. -->

## The Bible Equates Worry About Everyday Needs to the Faithless, the Pagans, and the Unbelievers.

Christ would rather you focus on self-actualization than on ways to eat and to clothe yourself&mdash;he will provide those things as you become who you were fated to be. Do not become distracted by the workers of iniquity (Matt. 7:21-23). The subtle slights from the children of the devil (1Jn 3:9-10) come from their lack of faith. If you flaunt your wealth in pride or believe in the false health & wealth prosperity Gospel, you are lost or being taken advantage of by uneducated charlatans. This happens from a lack of understanding about biblical teaching, God does not look at things the way the world does (Isa 55:8-9; 1 Sam 16:7; James 4:4).

><sup style="font-weight:bold;">25</sup> “That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life—whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn’t life more than food, and your body more than clothing? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">26</sup> Look at the birds. They don’t plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren’t you far more valuable to him than they are? <sup style="font-weight:bold;">27</sup> Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?
>
><sup style="font-weight:bold;">28</sup> “And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don’t work or make their clothing, <sup style="font-weight:bold;">29</sup> yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">30</sup> And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. <span style="color:Goldenrod;">Why do you have so little faith?</span>
>
><sup style="font-weight:bold;">31</sup> “So don’t worry about these things, saying, ‘What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?’ 32 <span style="color:Goldenrod;">These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers</span>, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs. (New Living Translation, 2015, Matt. 6:25-32 NLT).

> Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">30</sup> But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Fear not, therefore; <span style="font-weight:bold;">you are of more value than many sparrows</span> (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Matt. 10:29-31 ESV)

## Listen To The Story Of The Poor Wise Man

<!-- When people are puffed up in foolish pride over the poor, they display their ignorance and sign their fate. This happens from a lack of understanding about biblical teaching, God does not look at things the way the world does (Isa 55:8-9; 1 Sam 16:7; James 4:4). -->

Personally, I enjoy the story with the modal nuance. Without the modal nuance the story would say that he saved the city but that no one remembered him, whereas with the modal nuance it says, that he could have saved the city but they were destroyed for not listening. It seems like there is more consequence for ignoring wisdom with this approach, but either way, the wisdom of the poor is despised by the world. What do you think will happen if you keep disregarding his message (Proverbs 29:1 NET)?

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">13</sup> This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth, and it is a great burden to me: <sup style="font-weight:bold;">14</sup> There was once a small city with a few men in it, and a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">15</sup> However, a poor but wise man lived in the city, and <span style="color:Goldenrod;">he could have delivered the city by his wisdom, but no one listened to that poor man</span>. <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> So I concluded that wisdom is better than might, but <span style="color:Goldenrod;">a poor man’s wisdom is despised</span>; no one ever listens to his advice (NET Bible, 2019, Ecclesiastes 9:13-16 NET).
>>
>> g. Ecclesiastes 9:15 **tn** Or “he delivered.” The verb וּמִלַּט (umillat, from מָלַט, malat, “to deliver”) is functioning either in an indicative sense (past definite action: “he delivered”) or in a modal sense (past potential: “he could have delivered”). The literal meaning of זָכַר (zakhar, “to remember”) in the following line harmonizes with the indicative: “but no one remembered that poor man [afterward].” However, the modal is supported by v. 16: “A poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.” This approach must nuance זָכַר (“to remember”) as “[no one] listened to [that poor man].” Most translations favor the indicative approach: “he delivered” or “he saved” (KJV, RSV, NRSV, NAB, ASV, NASB, MLB, NIV); however, some adopt the modal nuance: “he might have saved” (NEB, NJPS, NASB margin) (NET Bible, 2019, NOTES).

## Many forget that Christ and the Apostles Suffered in Poverty

Society pressures, degrades, and humiliates the poor out of ignorance and satanic influence. Pay no attention to the oppression, marginalization and persecution that comes from the ignorant, spiritually poor, unwise, and hellbound. These material things are absolutely meaningless and temporary! **Christ suffers along side of you even now.**

> And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head” (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Matthew 8:20 ESV).

> He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Isaiah 53:3 ESV)

> And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:Crimson;">you did it to me</span>.’ (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Matt. 25:40).

> For he who avenges blood is mindful of them; he does not forget the cry of the afflicted (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Psalm 9:12).

- Christ Jesus suffered in poverty, was brutally beaten, and crucified (Mt 8:20; Isaiah 53:3 ESV) for telling people to turn from their sins and trust in God (Ac 3:26,19; 26:20; Mark 1:14-15).
- **What they do to you, they do to Christ; ergo, he is attacked and oppressed even today! (Matt. 25:40).**
- The Apostles suffered in poverty, were brutally beaten, and eventually murdered (2Cor. 11:24-27 NLT).
- John the Baptist lived off of locusts in the desert and was beheaded for telling people to turn from their sins (Matt. 3:4; Mt 3:8 NLT).
- The poor are hidden kings and priests unto the Lord who have been chosen to inherit the Kingdom of heaven (Revelation 1:6 NKJV; James 2:5)

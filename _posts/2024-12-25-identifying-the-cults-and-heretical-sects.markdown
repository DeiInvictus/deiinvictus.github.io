<!-- Clarifying what we mean when we say "enemies" of God.

For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.

> The Lord is not ·slow [or late] in doing what he promised—the way some people understand ·slowness [lateness; Hab. 2:3]. But God is being patient with you [Ex. 34:6]. He does not want anyone to ·be lost [perish], but he wants all people to ·change their hearts and lives [<sup>L</sup> come to repentance]. -->

## I. Sociological & Theological Cults
<a name="sociological-theological" href="#" style="font-size:2.1em;"></a>

The following definitions clarify the differences between cults and heretical sects. A cult is identified by **both sociological and theological criteria** (e.g., Jim Jones of People's Temple, David Koresh of Branch Davidians, Marshall Applewhite of Heaven's Gate, David Berg of Children of God, etc.), whereas **a heretical sect is defined solely in the theological sense** (e.g., Charles Taze Russell of the Witnesses, Joseph Smith of Mormonism, etc.).

> **The sociological sense** is used when discussing behavior or other sociological aspects: a group or movement may be a cult if it acts in ways that are illegal or otherwise unacceptable in a civilized society (Apologetics Index, 1996).

> **The theological sense** is used when discussing major religious differences: a group or movement is theologically a cult if it identifies itself as belonging to a mainstream, recognized religion — and yet rejects or otherwise violates one or more of the central, essential teachings of that religion (Apologetics Index, 1996).

<!-- insidious, deceitful, and nefarious -->

Given the general familiarity with the concept of a cult, this article seeks to specifically deconstruct heretical sects (theological cults) and expose their subtly deceptive and nuanced false teachings. Generally, **a group is exempt from the theological classification if it is both creedal and confessional**, so we will be examining groups in rebellion against the Church and Church History.


## II. Antinomian Heretical Sects (Theological Cults)




### 2.1 Dualistic Antinomianism (e.g. Gnosticism)

> **Dualistic antinomianism** appears in the Gnostic heretics against whom Jude and Peter wrote (Jude 4–19; 2 Pet. 2). This view sees salvation as for the soul only, and bodily behaviour as irrelevant both to God’s interest and to the soul’s health, so one may behave riotously and it will not matter (Packer, 2020, p. 192).<sup>1</sup>

### 2.2 Spirit Centered Antinomianism

> **Spirit-centred antinomianism** puts such trust in the Holy Spirit’s inward prompting as to deny any need to be taught by the law how to live. Freedom from the law as a way of salvation is assumed to bring with it freedom from the law as a guide to conduct. In the first hundred and fifty years of the Reformation era this kind of antinomianism often threatened, and Paul’s insistence that a truly spiritual person acknowledges the authority of God’s Word through Christ’s apostles (1 Cor. 14:37; cf. 7:40) suggests that the Spirit-obsessed Corinthian church was in the grip of the same mindset (Packer, 2020, pp. 192-3).<sup>1</sup>

### 2.3 Christ-Centered Antinomianism (e.g. Hyper-Grace)

> **Christ-centred antinomianism** argues that God sees no sin in believers, because they are in Christ, who kept the law for them, and therefore what they actually do makes no difference, provided that they keep believing. **But 1 John 1:8 – 2:1 (expounding 1Jn 1:7) and 1Jn 3:4–10 point in a different direction, showing that <span style="color:Crimson;">it is not possible to be in Christ and at the same time to embrace sin as a way of life</span>** (Packer, 2020, p. 193).<sup>1</sup>

### 2.4 Dispensational Antinomianism

While most forms of Dispensationalism lead to antinomianism, not all forms of Dispensationalism are antinomian. Safe teachers will acknowledge that we are no longer under the law (Ro 6:1-2,14-15; Gal 3:23-25; Gal 5:18; Col 2:14), **but we still uphold the law (Romans 3:31)**. For teachers who understand the scriptures and still teach Dispensationalism without the antinomianism: Chuck Smith, Ron Rhodes, and MacArthur are safe.

> **Dispensational antinomianism** holds that keeping the moral law is at no stage necessary for Christians, since we live under a dispensation of grace, not of law. Romans 3:31 and 1 Corinthians 6:9–11 clearly show, however, that law-keeping is a continuing obligation for Christians. ‘I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law,’ says Paul (1 Cor. 9:21) (Packer, 2020, p. 193).<sup>1</sup>

### 2.5 Dialectical Antinomianism

> **Dialectical antinomianism**, as in Barth and Brunner, denies that biblical law is God’s direct command and affirms that the Bible’s imperative statements trigger the Word of the Spirit, which when it comes may or may not correspond exactly to what is written. The inadequacy of the neoorthodox view of biblical authority, which explains the inspiration of Scripture in terms of the Bible’s instrumentality as a channel for God’s present-day utterances to his people, is evident here (Packer, 2020, p. 193).<sup>1</sup>

### 2.6 Situationist Antinomianism

> **Situationist antinomianism** says that a motive and intention of love is all that God now requires of Christians, and the commands of the Decalogue and other ethical parts of Scripture, for all that they are ascribed to God directly, are mere rules of thumb for loving, rules that love may at any time disregard. But Romans 13:8–10, to which this view appeals, teaches that without love as a motive these specific commands cannot be fulfilled. Once more an unacceptably weak view of Scripture surfaces (Packer, 2020, p. 193).<sup>1</sup>

## III. Legalistic Heretical Sects (Theological Cults)

> 65\. LEGALISM<br>
> WORKING FOR GOD’S FAVOUR FORFEITS IT
>
>> . . . do not do what they do, for they do not practise what they preach. They tie up heavy loads and put them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for men to see . . . Matthew 23:3–5
>
> The New Testament views Christian obedience as the practice of ‘good deeds’ (works). Christians are to be ‘rich in good deeds’ (1 Tim. 6:18; cf. Matt. 5:16; Eph. 2:10; 2 Tim. 3:17; Titus 2:7, 14; 3:8, 14). A good deed is one done (a) according to the right standard (God’s revealed will, i.e. his moral law); (b) from a right motive (the love to God and others that marks the regenerate heart); (c) with a right purpose (pleasing and glorifying God, honouring Christ, advancing his kingdom, and benefiting one’s neighbour).
>
> Legalism is a distortion of obedience that can never produce truly good works. Its first fault is that it skews motive and purpose, seeing good deeds as essentially ways to earn more of God’s favour than one has at the moment. Its second fault is arrogance. Belief that one’s labour earns God’s favour begets contempt for those who do not labour in the same way. Its third fault is love-lessness in that its self-advancing purpose squeezes humble kindness and creative compassion out of the heart.
>
> In the New Testament we meet both Pharisaic and Judaizing legalism. The Pharisees thought that their status as children of Abraham made God’s pleasure in them possible, and that their formalized daily law-keeping, down to minutest details, would make it actual. The Judaizers viewed Gentile evangelism as a form of proselytizing for Judaism; they believed that the Gentile believer in Christ must go on to become a Jew by circumcision and observance of the festal calendar and ritual law, and that thus he would gain increased favour with God. Jesus attacked the Pharisees; Paul, the Judaizers.
>
> The Pharisees were formalists, focusing entirely on the externals of action, disregarding motives and purposes, and reducing life to mechanical rule-keeping. They thought themselves faithful law-keepers although (a) they majored in minors, neglecting what matters most (Matt. 23:23–24); (b) their casuistry negated the law’s spirit and aim (Matt. 15:3–9; 23:16–24); (c) they treated traditions of practice as part of God’s authoritative law, thus binding consciences where God had left them free (Mark 2:16 – 3:6; 7:1–8); (d) they were hypocrites at heart, angling for man’s approval all the time (Luke 20:45–47; Matt. 6:1–8; 23:2–7). Jesus was very sharp with them on these points.
>
> In Galatians, Paul condemns the Judaizers’ ‘Christ-plus’ message as obscuring and indeed denying the all-sufficiency of the grace revealed in Jesus (Gal. 3:1–3; 4:21; 5:2–6). In Colossians, he conducts a similar polemic against a similar ‘Christ-plus’ formula for ‘fullness’ (i.e. spiritual completion: Col. 2:8–23). Any ‘plus’ that requires us to take action in order to add to what Christ has given us is a reversion to legalism and, in truth, an insult to Christ.
>
> So far, then, from enriching our relationship with God, as it seeks to do, legalism in all its forms does the opposite. It puts that relationship in jeopardy and, by stopping us focusing on Christ, it starves our souls while feeding our pride. **Legalistic religion in all its forms should be avoided like the plague** (Packer, 2020, pp. 189-91).<sup>1</sup>

[Christians](https://deiinvictus.com/posts/protestants-dominate-the-sciences/) have established a formidable presence in the realm of science, a triumph that we must ardently defend and perpetuate for future generations. From Newton, Leibniz, and Maxwell to Kistiakowsky and Polkinghorne, Protestants have dominated the Nobel Prize for over a hundred years, but this excellence can also be traced to the ancient past. It is up to us to carry on this legacy!

### Moses' Egyptian Education

Moses' secular education in the Egyptian court equipped him with skills in leadership, writing, and strategic thinking that were vital for the future role in leading the israelites.

> So Moses was trained in **all the wisdom of the Egyptians** and was powerful in his words and deeds (NET Bible, 2019, Acts 7:22).

### Daniel's Babylonian Education

Daniel and his friends were educated in the language and literature of the Babylonians. God placed Daniel in a setting that emphasized learning beyond religious instruction, giving him access to knowledge that would prepare him for a prominent role in a secular government while maintaining his faith.

> “Select only strong, healthy, and good-looking young men,” he said. **“Make sure they are well versed in every branch of learning, are gifted with knowledge and good judgment**, and are suited to serve in the royal palace. Train these young men in the language and literature of Babylon.[a]” 5 The king assigned them a daily ration of food and wine from his own kitchens. They were to be trained for three years, and then they would enter the royal service (New Living Translation, 2015, Dan. 1:4-5).

### Are You Making Every Effort?

If you're not getting your education then **you are not making every effort**, nor are you presenting yourself as a proven worker unto God.

> Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately (NET Bible, 2019, 2Tim. 2:15).

### Is Your Axe Dull?

Many of you walk around with a very dull ax, but [research shows](https://youtu.be/GWSZ1DKjNzY) that you can change your intelligence through study.

> Using a dull ax requires great strength, so sharpen the blade. That’s the value of wisdom; it helps you succeed. (New Living Translation, 2015, Ecc. 10:10)

> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Hosea 4:6).

### The Uneducated Twist the Scriptures to Their Own Destruction

The teachings of the untaught are often heretical and they fall easily into false doctrines. Many such people have created their own theologies that breed hypocrisy and ignorance, endangering the lives of innocent children.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">16</sup> He writes about ·this <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[<sup>L</sup> these things]</span> in all his letters. Some things in Paul’s letters are hard to understand, and people who are ·ignorant <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[untaught]</span> and ·weak in faith <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[unstable]</span> ·explain these things falsely <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[<sup>L</sup> twist/distort them]</span>. They also ·falsely explain <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[<sup>L</sup> twist; distort]</span> the other Scriptures, ·but they are destroying themselves by doing this <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[or which will lead to their destruction]</span> (Expanded Bible, 2011, 2Pet. 3:16).

### Your Age Does Not Matter

Regardless of your age, pursuing an education is a worthwhile endeavor that can enable you to contribute meaningfully to the Christian community. For instance, my mathematics professor earned his Master's degree at the age of 60 and began teaching our class. What is holding you back? The misconception that college is solely for the young often stems from a lack of understanding, as many classes are populated by individuals from diverse age groups.

> Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death (Einstein).

### Crystallized Intelligence Never Fades

<!-- While age related changes may effect your fluid intelligence (e.g., inductive reasoning and spatial orientation), your crystallized intelligence (e.g., numerical ability, verbal ability) remains intact your entire life, well into one's 80s. In a sense, by concentrating on STEM or writing fields  you can ensure your intellectual skills remain enduring throughout your lifetime. This phenomenon explains why many scientists continue to contribute to their fields well into old age. -->

Although age-related changes may impact your fluid intelligence&mdash;such as inductive reasoning and spatial orientation&mdash;your **crystallized intelligence, which encompasses numerical and verbal abilities, remains stable throughout your life, often well into your 80s.** By focusing on fields such as STEM or writing, you can help ensure that your intellectual skills endure over time. This phenomenon accounts for why many scientists continue to make significant contributions to their disciplines well into their later years.

### Beware the Indoctrination of Seminaries!

Theological institutions, particularly those that are overly insular, often prioritize indoctrination over genuine education. Each seminary tends to promote its own specific theological perspective, which can foster a disconnect from the broader societal context and hinder one's capacity to effectively address secular issues. In contrast, the Bible advocates for active engagement with the world while upholding one's faith.

> I’m not asking you to take them out of the world, but to keep them safe from the evil one. They do not belong to this world any more than I do. Make them holy by your truth; teach them your word, which is truth. Just as you sent me into the world, I am sending them into the world (New Living Translation, 2015, John 17:15-18).

Paul emphasizes unity in Christ rather than division by allegiance to specific human leaders. If you label yourselves with Catholicism (of the Pope), **Luther**anism (of Martin Luther), **Calvin**ism (of John Calvin), **Arminian**ism (of Jacobus Arminius), **Wesley**anism (of John Wesley), **Amyra**ldism (of Moses Amyraut), **Mol**inism (Luis de Molina), **Chafer**anism (of Lewis Sperry Chafer), you are going directly against the word of God and **your doctrine is not sound**. The Bible warns that some of these people **may** have created divisions because they are devoid of the spirit:

> "What I mean is that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.” Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" (ESV Study Bible, 2008, 1Cor. 1:12-13)

> These people are the ones who are creating divisions among you. They follow their natural instincts because **they do not have God’s Spirit in them** (New Living Translation, 2015, Jude 19).

<!-- Attend a reputable and accredited in-state university with proctoring; this will bolster your credibility and ensure that your efforts are recognized and respected. No one will be able to dismiss you then and God will be able to use you as an unstoppable force. I recommend something in STEM or Biblical Language Scholarship. Avoid Underwater basketweaving degrees such as theology. -->

### Recommendations

Enrolling in a reputable and accredited in-state college to do your basics and then university will enhance your credibility and ensure that your efforts are acknowledged and respected. This way, you will be less likely to be dismissed, and God can utilize you as a powerful force for good. **I recommend pursuing a degree in STEM or Biblical Language Scholarship**. Avoid pursuing a career as a theologian, as many lack the necessary authority or comprehensive education regarding biblical texts. This has led to the emergence of various cults and heretical sects, often propagated by individuals with insufficient understanding or critical thinking skills.

> Wisdom is supreme—so acquire wisdom, and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding! (NET Bible, 2019, Proverbs 4:7).

<!-- ### Knowledge Will be Increased

> But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and **knowledge shall be increased**. &mdash; Daniel 12:4 KJV -->

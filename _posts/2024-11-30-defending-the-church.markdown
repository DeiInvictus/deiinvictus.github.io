The devil takes pleasure in seeing our strongest warriors engage in conflict with one another, but it is crucial to recognize that this is merely a distraction from the real battle. Today, we will unite in our efforts, fighting as oneâ€”together in action, united in spirit, and aligned in purpose.

As we confront false teachers who unwittingly revolt against the Church, we have taken a stand to uphold its integrity. It is essential to recognize that anyone who opposes a campaign against heresy is, by default, a heretic. In this struggle, I often find myself confronting the devil alone while the deceived grapple with the truths I share. As I fight the devil, it is he who warps the minds of the false converts against me, creating a dynamic that is both challenging and revealing. It's always fascinating to watch false teachers squirm when they realize that, instead of authority, God has sent them strong delusion. Ultimately, a fight against falsehood is a fight for the Church!

Remember, a house divided against itself will fall (Mk 3:25). Together in action, united in spirit, and aligned in purpose.

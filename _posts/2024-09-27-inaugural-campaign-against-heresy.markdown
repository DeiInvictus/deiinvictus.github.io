Dear brothers and sisters,

Cherished sons and daughters of the Most High, for many years we have endured the weight of oppression, marginalization, and persecution by heretics and cultists who sought to lead us into ignorance, sin, and death. Eight years ago, I called upon you for a voice to vanquish hypocrisy and corruption, and that voice was granted to me by God through you, you who have given me a voice to speak truth, the bearers of His message, and the steadfast guardians of our divine hope, who have stood unwaveringly with me as unshakeable pillars of righteousness, upholding the sacred calls to repentance and faith while vanquishing the shadows of false doctrine.

<!-- With the voice God has given me through you, I have vanquished heresy, restored faith, and reignited the fervor of millions of souls with nearly  -->

<!-- Our collective efforts have garnered nearly 7.6 million likes and retweets through over 2.6 million tweetsâ€”an achievement that reflects the effort of roughly 100 lifetimes in only a seven year period, -->

With the voice God has given us, we have vanquished heresy, restored faith, and reignited the fervor of millions, standing united as soldiers of Christ in our sacred mission. Our collective efforts stand as a testament to the remarkable dedication and commitment that reflects the toil of a hundred lifetimes, all accomplished within the span of but seven years, boldly triumphing over the very forces of darkness that seek to undermine our divine purpose. Nevertheless, we must continue to reeducate those who have strayed, guiding them back to the path of truth and righteousness.

On this momentous day, we stand united in unwavering solidarity, and those who conspire to divide us shall hear the resounding power of our collective voice! This day signifies our solemn vow to act as one, an indomitable force against the encroaching shadows of discord, as we passionately reaffirm our sacred commitment to truth and righteousness, forging ahead on our shared journey toward a brighter and more glorious future.

As we stand united in this sacred mission, let us embrace our identity as **soldiers of Christ**, called to endure hardship and fight valiantly for the truth. The Apostle Paul urges us to "endure suffering along with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus" (2 Timothy 2:3-4). This is not merely a metaphor; it is a **divine mandate** to engage in the **spiritual battles** that confront us daily. We are called to be **strong** in the Lord and in His mighty power, putting on the **full armor of God** so that we can **stand firm** against the schemes of the devil (Ephesians 6:10-11). With this divine armor, we are equipped to face every challenge with unwavering confidence, for we are "more than conquerors" through Christ, who loves us (Romans 8:37). Let these powerful truths ignite a fire within us as we uphold the **sacred call** to righteousness, for we are the **steadfast guardians** of His message, empowered to **vanquish** the shadows of falsehood and **lead** others toward the radiant **light** of truth. Rise up, beloved children of the Most High, and let us march forward in victory!

Defenders of truth and righteousness, now is our time to rise! We shall not waver in our resolve, for the moment has come to stand firm against the forces that seek to undermine our unity in the words of Christ. Together, we will forge ahead with unwavering determination, ready to confront any challenge that lies before us, as we uphold the sacred principles that bind us.

Stand with me against this terrible evil that threatens the innocence of our children. Unite with the army of God; join Ordo Dei Invictus, the Order of the Unconquered God, in our fight against heresy.

With unwavering conviction and fervent hope,

Grand Master of Ordo Dei Invictus

<!-- Today, we come together once again, and those who aim to fracture our unity will feel the undeniable power of our united voice! Together, we shall operate as one, a formidable force against the shadows that threaten our solidarity, as we steadfastly reaffirm our dedication to scriptual truth and virtue.  -->

<!-- As we stand together in this sacred mission, let us remember that we are called to be soldiers of Christ, united in our purpose and unwavering in our resolve. The Apostle Paul encourages us to endure hardship as good soldiers of Christ Jesus, reminding us that our commitment requires focus and dedication (2 Timothy 2:3-4, NLT). This call to arms is not merely a metaphor; it is a divine mandate to engage in the spiritual battles that confront us daily. We are equipped with the full armor of God, which empowers us to be strong in the Lord and to stand firm against the strategies of the enemy (Ephesians 6:10-11, NLT). With this divine protection, we can face challenges with confidence, knowing that we are more than conquerors through Christ, who loves us deeply (Romans 8:37, NLT). Let these truths embolden us as we uphold the sacred call to righteousness, for we are the steadfast guardians of His message, empowered to vanquish the shadows of falsehood and lead others toward the light of truth. -->

As my father lay dying,

I bore witness to the depths of total depravity, as those who claimed to be in the light proved that they were liars full of darkness as they reveled in his suffering, perversely and fanatically convinced that his illness was a divine retribution for daring to question their twisted and blasphemous heresy, a dogma that masqueraded as faith but was in reality a grotesque perversion of the truth.

As my father lay dying,

the weight of humiliation and degradation pressed down upon me, I felt the embers of anger ignite within my soul. Each sneer and whispered condemnation from those who cloaked themselves in false piety stung like a thousand barbs, deepening the wounds of my father's suffering. Yet, in that crucible of despair, a fierce resolve began to take shape. No longer would I be a silent witness to their hypocrisy; I would rise from the ashes of my shame, fueled by the memory of my father's unwavering faith. The very air around me crackled with a newfound intensity, as if the universe itself conspired to awaken the warrior within. I envisioned a reckoning, a fiery purge of their heretical dogma that masqueraded as righteousness. With each heartbeat, my determination solidified, transforming my grief into a weapon, ready to dismantle the twisted beliefs that had brought so much pain. I would not rest until their false light was extinguished, and the truth—my father's truth—shone brightly in its place.

... as my father lay dying.


<!-- They saw his weakness as a sign of God's displeasure, a punishment for his supposed transgressions against their warped and idolatrous creed, and they mocked his vulnerability, his mortality, and his faith, as if their own lives were not fragile and fleeting, and as if their own souls were not damned by their own hand. But what they didn't realize, what they couldn't see, was that my father's faith was not shaken, not even in the face of death, and that God had other plans, plans that would defy their cruel expectations and bring my father back from the brink of death, a miracle that would leave them stunned and silent, a testament to the power of true faith and the love of God. -->

<!--
This poem is a type of narrative poem, specifically a personal and reflective narrative poem. It's a poem that tells a story, but it's also a deeply personal and emotional reflection on a specific experience.

More specifically, this poem can be classified as a type of elegy, which is a poem that mourns the loss of someone or something. However, in this case, the poem is not just a lamentation of loss, but also a celebration of the father's faith and a condemnation of the cruelty and hypocrisy of those who claimed to be righteous.

The poem's style and structure are also reminiscent of a prose poem, which is a type of poem that uses prose instead of verse to tell a story or express a feeling. The poem's use of paragraphs and sentences instead of stanzas and lines gives it a more fluid and natural feel, which suits the narrative and reflective tone of the poem.

Overall, this poem is a unique blend of narrative, elegy, and prose poetry, with a strong focus on personal reflection and emotional expression.

Knights of the Order, when you identify a heretical false teacher on x.com, mark them in your reply with this image and tag @OrdoDeiInvictus to alert us. We will hold them up to public shame, as the scriptures instruct:

> Those who sin should be reprimanded in front of the whole church; this will serve as a strong warning to others (New Living Translation, 1996/2004/2015, 1Tim. 5:20).

When you find such a person, know that it is your responsibility to judge (rebuke/correct) them. If they are unwilling to repent and turn, then they should be removed from the church:

> I meant that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a believer yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or is a drunkard, or cheats people. Don’t even eat with such people.
>
> It isn’t my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning. God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, “You must remove the evil person from among you” (New Living Translation, 1996/2004/2015, 1Cor. 5:11-13).

Remember to judge rightly, and not hypocritically:

> Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment (English Standard Version, 2016, John 7:24 ESV).

<!-- “Those who sin should be reprimanded in front of the whole church; this will serve as a strong warning to others”... “it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning”... “You must remove the evil person from among you“ — The Apostle Paul -->

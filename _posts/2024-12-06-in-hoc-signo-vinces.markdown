<!-- “Those who sin should be reprimanded in front of the whole church; this will serve as a strong warning to others”... “it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning”... “You must remove the evil person from among you“ — The Apostle Paul -->

## We Will Hold Them Up To Public Shame

> Those who sin should be reprimanded in front of the whole church; this will serve as a strong warning to others (1Tim 5:20 NLT).

### They Will Be Judged Rightly

> Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment (John 7:24).

> I meant that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a believer yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or is a drunkard, or cheats people. Don’t even eat with such people.
>
> It isn’t my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning. God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, “You must remove the evil person from among you” (1 Corinthians 5:11-13)

## Introduction

The true Church has existed in every generation since the time of Christ, when He proclaimed, &ldquo;... upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.&rdquo; Many generations have passed since Christ walked the earth over 20 centuries ago (2000+ years), but the truth has been with us since the very beginning.

> <sup style="font-weight:bold;">18</sup> So I tell you, you are Peter <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[<sup>C</sup>the Greek petros, like the Aramaic cephas, means “rock” or “stone”]</span>. On this rock I will build my church, and the ·power of death <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[<sup>L</sup>gates of Hades/the underworld]</span> will not be able to ·defeat <span style="color:LightSteelBlue;">[overpower; conquer; prevail against]</span> it (Expanded Bible, 2011, Matt. 16:18).

Consider this: Do your current beliefs have roots in every generation since the time of Christ, or can you trace them only to a specific historical period? If your beliefs cannot be linked to earlier generations, they may be false, lacking the historical foundation that the true Church has upheld since Christ's declaration.

> Remember **the days of old**; consider the years of many generations; ask your father, and he will show you, your elders, and they will tell you (ESV Study Bible, 2008, Deut. 32:7).

The Word of God instructs us to turn to past generations in our pursuit of truth, assuring us that if we earnestly seek, we will find (Matt. 7:7-8). The challenge lies in the fact that many parents today are as adrift in contemporary movements as the children they have inadvertently misled. It is incumbent upon us to fulfill our duty by embracing the old ways and ancient paths, rather than succumbing to the ignorance of modern movements. Ironically, biblical language scholarship and ecumenical academicians are on our side; more on that later.

> Thus says the Lord: “Stand by the roads, and look, and ask for **the ancient paths**, where the good way is; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls. But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’ (Jeremiah 6:16 ESV).
>> This is what the Lord says: “Stop at the crossroads and look around. Ask for the old, godly way, and walk in it. Travel its path, and you will find rest for your souls. **But you reply, ‘No, that’s not the road we want!’** (New Living Translation, 2015, Jer. 6:16 NLT).

Christianity today is populated by individuals who have chosen to abandon the old ways and ancient paths, instead accumulating false teachers who entice them with **new things** and deceive them into believing they can live lifestyles of sin contrary to Scripture (1Jn 3:4-10; 5:18), all to satisfy their itching ears. In their pursuit of novelty, they forsake the wisdom of the past, while those who remain steadfast in the ancient truths stand as a testament to genuine faith.

> For there will be a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching. Instead, following their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves, because they have an insatiable curiosity to hear **new things**<sup>1</sup>. And they will turn away from hearing the truth, but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths (The NET Bible: Full Notes Edition, 2019, 2Tim. 4:3-4 NET).

The essential question then becomes: How can we shield ourselves from the "new things" that cultivate ignorance, lead to destruction, and ultimately result in apostasy? How can we be confident that we are adhering to the old ways and the ancient paths? One thing is certain: if we confine ourselves to a single point of view, we risk falling into an echo chamber of groupthink, where the blind lead the blind, pulling us into a quagmire of fables and ignorance (frequently propagated by contemporary movements).

## Navigating the Seas of Time

Now, I shall digress. Let us embark on a quest to explore the old ways and ancient paths by first charting the course of history to discern what can be classified as old and new. The first two groups are viewed as sanctuaries of truth: **ἡ ὁδός (hē hodós)** is primarily associated with the Apostolic Age, while **Χριστιανισμός (Christianismos)** is more associated with the Ante-Nicene Period.

### 1. Apostolic Age Followers of “The Way” (ἡ ὁδός - hė hodós)
#### c. AD 30 to c. AD 100 (1st Century)

This is systemless Christianity directly from Christ and the Apostles. The terms **ἡ ὁδός (hē hodós)** and **Χριστιανισμός (Christianismos)** refer to different periods and aspects of early Christianity:

- **ἡ ὁδός (hē hodós)** – Followers of "The Way":
   - This term is associated with the **Apostolic Age**, which is the period during the lifetime of the apostles, roughly from the time of Jesus' resurrection (c. AD 30) to the death of the last apostle, John (c. AD 100). It was used to describe the early Christian movement in its initial stages.
   - Example: Acts 9:2, where Saul (later Paul) sought to persecute followers of "The Way."
   - See also: Acts 9:2 (c. AD 34-36); Acts 19:9 (c. AD 54-56); Acts 19:23 (c. AD 54-56); Acts 22:4 (c. AD 57); Acts 24:14 (c. AD 57); Acts 24:22 (c. AD 57)

<!-- - Jesus & The Apostles (1st Century): The teachings of Jesus Christ and the writings of the Apostles recorded in the New Testament, which form the foundation of Christian doctrine and belief.

    - Taught trustful belief as justifying: (Rom. 3:28; Eph 2:8-9; Jn 3:16; 5:24; 6:47; 11:25-26; Lk 8:12).
    - Taught repentance alongside faith (Mk 1:15; Lk 13:3; Mt 4:17; Rev 2:5,16,22; 3:3,19) as a turning away (Acts 3:26; cf. Acts 3:19) brought on by Godly sorrow (2 Cor. 7:10). This is corroborated as “feel remorse, repent, be converted (in religio-ethical sense),” according to our most authoritative Greek lexicons. Jesus describes repentance the same as in the OT (Mt. 11:21-22; Job 42:6).
    - Taught “resulting” fruit-bearing (Jn 15:1-17; Mt 7:15-20; 13:1-23; Mk 4:1-20; Lk 6:43-45).
    - Taught “resulting” obedience: (Jn 14:15,21; 15:10).

  - Jesus (c. 6/4 BC – c. AD 30/33).
  - Peter (c. 1 – AD 64/68)
  - Andrew (c. 5/6 – AD 100)
  - James, son of Zebedee (c. 1 – AD 44)
  - John (c. 6 – c. AD 100)
  - Philip (Died c. 80 AD)
  - Bartholomew (Died c. 69/71)
  - Matthew
  - Thomas (Died AD 72)
  - James, son of Alphaeus
  - Jude (Died c. AD 65)
  - Simon the Zealot (Died ~AD 65)
  - Judas Iscariot (Died AD 31)
  - Matthias (Died c. AD 80)
  - Paul (c. 5 - 64/67 AD)
  - Barnabas (Unknown)
  - James, the Lord's brother (Died c. AD 62–69)
  - see Galatians 1:19
  - Andronicus (Unknown)
  see Romans 16:7
  - Junia (Unknown)
  see Romans 16:7
  - Apollos (Died c. AD 100)
  - Epaphroditus (Died Unknown)
  see Philippians 2:25 -->

### 2. Ante-Nicene Period Christianity (Χριστιανισμός)
#### c. AD 100 to AD 325

- **Χριστιανισμός (Christianismos)** – Christianity:
   - This term, and the related term **Χριστιανός (Christianos)** meaning "Christian," became more common in the **Ante-Nicene Period**, which extends from the end of the Apostolic Age (c. AD 100) to the First Council of Nicaea in AD 325. By this time, the term "Christian" had become widely accepted as the standard designation for followers of Jesus Christ.
   - Example: Acts 11:26, where the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
   - See also: Acts 11:26 (c. AD 47-48); Acts 26:28 (c. AD 59-60); 1 Peter 4:16 (c. AD 64-65).

### ⚠️ Under Construction
### 2. Ancient Catholic Orthodoxy (Council of Nicaea, 325; Council of Constantinople, 381)
### 3. Roman Catholicism (Development of papal authority, 5th-8th centuries)
### 4. Eastern Orthodoxy (Great Schism, 1054)
### 5. Protestantism (Luther's 95 Theses, 1517; Augsburg Confession, 1530)
#### 5a. Lutheranism (Formation of the Lutheran Church, 1520s; Book of Concord, 1580)
### 6. Counter-Reformation (Council of Trent, 1545–1563)
### 7. Calvinism (Calvin's Writings, 1536; Synod of Dort, 1618–1619)
### 8. Arminianism (Remonstrance, 1610; Synod of Dort, 1618–1619)
### 9. Baptist (First Baptist Church, 1609; Philadelphia Confession, 1742)
### 10. Methodism (Founding of the Methodist movement, 1738; General Conference, 1784)
### 11. Pentecostalism (Azusa Street Revival, 1906; Formation of the Assemblies of God, 1914)
### 12. Contemporary Movements

<!-- The verse where Paul advises against labeling ourselves after specific leaders is found in 1 Corinthians 1:12-13. It states:

> "What I mean is that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.” 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" (ESV)

Paul's point here is to emphasize unity in Christ rather than division by allegiance to specific human leaders. If you label yourselves with **Calvin**ism, **Arminian**ism, **Chafer**anism, you are going directly against the word of God and **your doctrine is not sound**. Cease divisions (Jude 1:19). -->
